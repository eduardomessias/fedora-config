# fedora-settings
My custom fedora settings

I'll keep all custom settings files here, so when I install Fedora in a new machine, I can reuse them.

## VimRC

- [1st of all, watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9k9scbTuvQ)
- [Keep this repo close as well](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

No worries, it's all saved in here. 
- Download the folder vim and the file vimrc.
- Move them to the home folder of your user.
- Make them hidden, so you dont mess around without a reason. Or you do.
